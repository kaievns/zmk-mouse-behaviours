# zmk-mouse-behaviours

My attempt at baking some ZMK custom behaviours to work with point devices
transformers and such.

Most of this work derived from amazing work by @badjeff over
[here](https://github.com/badjeff/zmk-input-behavior-listener) and @petejohanson
over [here](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2477)
